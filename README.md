# Advent

My solutions to the 2022 advent of code.

To run an task, place your input in the "input.txt" for the given day, and run the test.

```
$ mix test test/advent_tests
```

To start a new day, open iex

```bash
$ iex -S mix
```

.. and type

```bash
$ Advent.NewDay.new(int [NUMBER_OF_DAY], string [Name of the mission])
```
